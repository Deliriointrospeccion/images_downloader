# Image grabber

Tool for downloading images from old html indexes such as
http://isis.bibna.gub.uy/imagenes/

Prototype project, **Work in progress**

To use it, clone the repo and run:
```bash
ruby app.rb [url]
```

Use with caution, this will recursively visit all the folders in the
site (at least until something blows up).
